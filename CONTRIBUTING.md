# Contributing to Flight Price Tracker

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Flight Price Tracker. It's people like you that make Flight Price Tracker such a great tool.

## Getting started

Before you begin:
- Do you know how to [use Git and GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)?
- Have you read the code of conduct?

### Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Flight Price Tracker](https://github.com/weckerleben/flight-price-tracker/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```sh
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

- We indent using four spaces (soft tabs).
- We follow PEP8 for Python code style.
- We comment extensively, explaining why instead of what.
- We CLEAN UP after ourselves.

## Conduct

We have adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.
