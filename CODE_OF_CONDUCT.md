## Code of Conduct for Taxpayers

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers are committed to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of different points of view and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism in a graceful manner
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy for other members of the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or images and unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Disparaging (trolling), insulting or disparaging comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Posting private information about others, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both in project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at *ing@williameckerleben.com*. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.
